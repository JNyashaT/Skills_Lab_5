What it does: 
The code takes in two inputs, name and age. The name just gets printed out at the end. However, the age is corresponding to a certain age bracket like teenager, adult, toddler, etc. Depending on the age entered, the program will print out what bracket you are in.  An example output would be "Hi Ruchi. You're a teenager!".
